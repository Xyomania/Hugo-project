# If You Are Already Blogging, Money May Be Just a Click Away

If you already spend a fair amount of time blogging, money may come to you literally as soon as you ask for it. Once you have an established blog with a regular readership, it is easy to turn a profit through advertising. By hosting sponsored links or banners, you can see income from your hobby almost overnight. Even if you did not start your blog intending to turn a profit, making supplementary income from your blog may be easier than you think.

## The Role of Blog Topic in Monetization

Of course, even for people who have spent months or years blogging, money from advertising revenue may not add up to a large sum. The amount of money that you can make as a blogger depends on a lot of different factors, but perhaps the most important element of the equation is the topic of your blog. 

If your blog is on a subject that appeals to a demographic that advertisers have a strong desire to reach, you will be more likely to turn a larger profit than if your blog covers a more obscure subject that does not draw the kind of audience advertisers need to target.

## Testing Your Monetization Potential

Of course, the only way to find out where you fall on this spectrum is to try hosting some ads. If you are already blogging, you have nothing to lose. Set up a few ads, track the results, and see if monetization works for your blog. 

It could be the first step toward turning your blog into a profitable venture!
