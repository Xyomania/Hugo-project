# Canon Digital Camera: Express, Shoot and Share

Canon is widely recognized as a leader in imaging equipment, known for producing a wide range of products such as copiers, printers, lenses, camcorders, and, of course, digital cameras. Among their most popular products are the Canon PowerShot series, which provides users with excellent features and performance. 

### PowerShot S2 IS

The **PowerShot S2 IS** is one of Canon's high-end digital cameras, offering an impressive 5.0-megapixel resolution. With a **12x optical zoom** and a **4x digital zoom**, it provides incredible versatility for shooting distant subjects. One of the standout features of the PowerShot S2 IS is its **Optical Image Stabilizer (IS)**, which reduces camera shake, making it ideal for users with shaky hands or those capturing fast-moving subjects. The **UD lens** offers excellent color accuracy throughout the zoom range, ensuring high-quality shots.

In addition to still images, the PowerShot S2 IS supports **video recording** with the innovative **Movie Snap feature**. This allows you to snap a photo while recording a video, capturing the perfect image during a moving shot. 

The camera is equipped with the **DIGIC II Image Processor**, which enhances processing speed, autofocus performance, and image quality. With this processor, the camera boasts **faster start-up times**, **improved playback**, and **enhanced autofocus**.

Another highlight of the S2 IS is its **USB 2.0 Hi-speed standard**, making file transfers quick and easy, especially when paired with a high-speed SD card. The camera also features a **1.8-inch LCD power-saving display**, and **30 frames per second shooting** for smooth video capture. Additionally, the camera offers settings for night-time photography, providing brighter images in low-light conditions.

### PowerShot SD500 and SD400

For those seeking a point-and-shoot option, Canon’s **PowerShot SD500** and **PowerShot SD400** models offer a more compact yet powerful choice. The **SD500** is the first 7.1-megapixel camera in the PowerShot series, delivering stunning image quality and intricate details. It comes with a **3x optical zoom**, making it great for capturing close-up shots, with a 37-111mm equivalent on a 35mm film camera.

The SD500 is designed with a **slim, ergonomic body** that fits perfectly in your hand, and its **2.0-inch LCD** screen offers easy framing and playback. Like other Canon cameras, the SD500 is equipped with the **DIGIC II Image Processor** for superior image quality and faster processing.

A standout feature of the SD500 is its ability to shoot **up to 60 frames per second** for video, ideal for capturing fast-moving subjects. It also supports a variety of **scene modes**, including:

- **Portrait**: Blurs the background to emphasize the subject.
- **Foliage**: Perfect for greenery or blossoms.
- **Beach**: Reduces dark faces in bright sunlight.
- **Underwater**: Minimizes background scatter (you can also purchase an optional waterproof case).
- **Fireworks, Night Snapshot, Kids and Pets**, and many others.

The SD500 also includes features like **skin tone adjustments** (lightening or darkening) to ensure the perfect look, even as you shoot.
