Roses are a gardener’s pride, but they can fall victim to various diseases that threaten their beauty and health. Here's a guide to identifying and addressing common rose problems to ensure your plants stay thriving.

### 1. **Black Spots on Leaves**  

- **Symptoms:** Circular black spots with fringed edges on leaves, causing them to yellow.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Remove infected foliage and fallen leaves around the rose.

- **Cause:** Powdery Mildew (a fungal disease).  
- **Symptoms:** White powder covering leaves, stems, and buds. Leaves may curl and turn purple.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Treat with Funginex or Benomyl sprays.

### 3. **Blistered Underside of Leaves**  

- **Cause:** Rust (a fungal disease).  
- **Symptoms:** Orange-red blisters on the underside of leaves that turn black in fall.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Collect and discard infected leaves in the fall.

### 4. **Malformed or Stunted Leaves and Flowers**  

- **Cause:** Spider Mites.  
- **Symptoms:** Tiny yellow, red, or green spiders on the underside of leaves that suck plant juices.

- **Cause:** Aphids.  
- **Symptoms:** Small, soft-bodied insects (brown, green, or red) clustered under leaves and flower buds, sucking plant juices.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Spray with Malathion or Diazinon to control aphid infestations.

### 6. **Flowers That Don’t Open or Are Deformed**  

- **Cause:** Thrips.
