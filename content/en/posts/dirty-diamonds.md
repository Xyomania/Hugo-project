# Dirty Diamonds: Understanding Rough and Unclean Diamonds

A **dirty diamond** can refer to two things: a **rough diamond** or a **polished diamond** that has become soiled over time. Understanding the differences and how to care for your diamond is essential for preserving its brilliance.

## Rough Diamonds: Uncut and Unpolished

A **rough diamond** is one that hasn't been cut or polished. These diamonds naturally appear "dirty" due to the presence of surface imperfections. However, once a rough diamond undergoes the cutting and polishing process, its true beauty emerges. Afterward, the diamond may become dirty again as it’s worn.

## Cleaned Diamonds Becoming Dirty

Even after being polished and set into jewelry, diamonds can accumulate dirt and oils. Common causes of a dirty diamond include:

- **Soap scum** from washing hands.
- **Oils and lotion** transferred from the skin.
- **Soap residue** from showering or bathing.

It’s amazing how quickly a diamond ring or piece of jewelry can collect residue, making it appear dull and losing its sparkle.

## Tips for Keeping Your Diamonds Clean

To ensure your diamonds stay as brilliant as the day you bought them, consider the following tips:

### 1. **Use an Ultrasonic Jewelry Cleaner**
An **ultrasonic cleaner** is a convenient tool for cleaning your diamonds. It uses high-frequency sound waves to remove dirt and oils effectively.

### 2. **Clean Regularly**
Daily cleaning can help maintain your diamond's shine. Taking a minute to gently clean your jewelry will prevent buildup of dirt and grime that can dull its sparkle.

### 3. **Avoid Harmful Chemicals**
When wearing your diamond jewelry, avoid exposing it to harsh chemicals or cleaners that can damage the diamond or setting.

### 4. **Store Properly**
When not wearing your diamonds, store them in a soft cloth pouch or a jewelry box with compartments to avoid scratches and dust buildup.

### 5. **Professional Cleaning**
Occasionally, have your diamond professionally cleaned and checked by a jeweler to ensure its longevity and maintain its brilliance.

## Conclusion: Keeping Your Diamonds Sparkling

Dirty diamonds—whether rough or polished—can lose their sparkle due to accumulated dirt, oils, and residues. Regular cleaning and proper care will ensure that your diamonds maintain their beauty and shine over time. With a little effort, your diamond jewelry will continue to dazzle for years to come.
