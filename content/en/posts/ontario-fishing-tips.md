## Ontario Fishing Tips

### **Getting Ready**

1. **Prepare Your Gear**  
   If you’re headed for a fishing trip to Ontario’s North Country, be prepared to spend on transportation, outfit, and licenses. The highlight for most anglers is fishing, so make sure to replace the line on your reel before you head out.

2. **Invest in Polarized Sunglasses**  
   Protect your eyes while fishing with high-quality polarized sunglasses. Not only will they protect your eyes, but they will also allow for better visibility into the water.

3. **Store Your Gear Properly**  
   Keep mosquito repellent and plastic worms in a separate compartment from your tackle box. Both items contain lacquer solvent that can damage the paint on your lures.

4. **Sharpen Your Hooks**  
   Always carry a small file or stone to keep your hooks sharp and ready for action.

5. **Master Knot-Tying**  
   Learn how to tie strong knots and practice until you're confident they will hold.

### **General Fishing Guidelines**

1. **Move Locations When Needed**  
   Don’t fish in one spot for more than 10 casts. If nothing changes, it’s time to move to a new location.

2. **Position Your Canoe Correctly**  
   Don’t get too close to the fish, as you may frighten them. Conversely, don’t be too far away, as it will make it difficult to cast your lure accurately.

3. **Be Cautious with Topwater Fishing**  
   Don’t set the hook until you feel the fish on the lure, and avoid startling the fish. Work the lure towards you slowly.

4. **Be Patient**  
   Ensure you’re in a suitable fishing area and give yourself plenty of time to catch fish.

5. **Be Quiet**  
   Sound travels through water better than through air, so keep noise levels down to avoid scaring the fish.

6. **Release Fish Carefully**  
   Release any fish you don’t plan to eat immediately and safely. Preserving Ontario's fishing resources is crucial for sustainable fishing.

7. **Enjoy the Surroundings**  
   Whether you're catching fish or not, take a moment to enjoy the beauty of Ontario's unique lakeland wilderness.

### **Fishing Regulations**

#### **Carry Your License**

- Residents of Canada should have a fishing-version Outdoors Card with a fishing license tag attached.  
- Non-residents should ensure their license form is signed and the correct tag is fastened to their license.  
- Remember, a fishing license is non-transferable and should always be carried when fishing.

#### **State and District Regulations**

- Ontario’s fishing laws are governed by the **Fisheries Act**, which protects fish and their habitats, and the **Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act**.  
- These laws cover fishing seasons, catch limits, size regulations, and gear restrictions.

#### **Wildlife Protection and Preservation Officers**

Wildlife Protection Officers have the authority to enforce regulations, including:

- Inspecting buildings and equipment.
- Stopping and examining vehicles, boats, or aircraft.
- Confiscating items related to violations.
- Arresting individuals suspected of committing offenses related to fishing laws.

#### **Open Seasons**

- Fishing seasons vary by species and region, and it is illegal to fish during closed seasons, even if the fish is going to be released afterward.  
- Closed seasons help protect fish during their most vulnerable spawning periods.  
- Unless otherwise specified, species not listed have a year-round open season.
