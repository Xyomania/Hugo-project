# Writing the Resource Box So It Makes People Click

The internet is often described as the **information highway**, a term that's been used so frequently it’s practically a cliché. But it’s true: people go online to search for information on everything from business tips to gaming strategies, and entertainment to education. 

For businesses and website owners, **generating traffic** through content is essential. This is where articles come in. Many websites, particularly those focused on **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**, use articles to attract visitors. When paired with a compelling **resource box**, articles can drive significant traffic.

A **resource box** appears at the end of an article, offering a brief description of the author or sponsoring site, often with a link back to the website. But crafting a **clickable resource box** that grabs attention is an art — and it can have a huge impact on driving visitors to your site.

## What is a Resource Box?

A resource box is typically located at the end of an article and includes:

- **Author’s name**  
- **A brief description of the author or the sponsoring site**  
- **A link back to the website**  

For example, if an article is about **tire rotation**, the resource box could link to a website selling tires or car parts. If readers find the article helpful, they’ll often click the resource box to explore related products or services.

While the resource box is small, it can pack a powerful punch for **traffic generation**. The key is to make it as compelling as possible.

## Why Is the Resource Box So Important?

The resource box is more than just a link back to your site — it's a tool for **driving targeted traffic** and building relationships with potential customers. Here’s why it’s critical to craft an engaging resource box:

### 1. **Drives Traffic to Your Website**

A well-written resource box can direct readers to your website, where they might explore your products, services, or offerings. This traffic could turn into **potential customers**, making your resource box a vital part of your marketing strategy.

### 2. **Increases Credibility**

Including a relevant resource box with useful content boosts your **credibility**. Readers who find value in your article are more likely to trust the link in the resource box, especially if it relates to the article topic.

### 3. **Boosts SEO with Backlinks**

Each time your article (and resource box) is published on other websites, you gain valuable **backlinks**. Backlinks are crucial for SEO, as search engines consider them votes of confidence in your content. More backlinks lead to better rankings and greater visibility.

## How to Write a Resource Box That Gets Clicked

Now that you know why a resource box is important, let’s discuss how to write one that encourages clicks:

### 1. **Use Relevant Keywords**

Just like in your article, **keywords** are essential in your resource box. Use relevant, **high-traffic keywords** that relate to both the article content and your website. This makes the link feel natural and increases the likelihood that readers will click.

### 2. **Create a Sense of Urgency or Curiosity**

Use **actionable language** to spark curiosity. Phrases like "Learn more about X," "Discover how to improve Y," or "Get exclusive tips on Z" motivate readers to click. Make them want to know more.

### 3. **Keep it Short and Clear**

Space is limited in the resource box, so make every word count. Keep your description concise, clear, and focused on the **benefit** the reader will get by clicking. Be specific about what they’ll find on your site.

### 4. **Use an Enticing Call to Action (CTA)**

End your resource box with a **strong call to action**. Phrases like "Click here for more," "Visit now for exclusive discounts," or "Find out why X is the best choice for you" can encourage immediate action.

### 5. **Maintain Consistency with the Article**

Your resource box should align with the article’s content. If the article discusses "How to Care for Your Tires," the resource box should link to a page about **car maintenance or tire sales**. This ensures a seamless experience for readers and builds trust.

## Example of a Strong Resource Box

Here’s an example that incorporates the tips above:

> **About the Author:**  
> John Smith is a certified mechanic with over 10 years of experience in car maintenance. He runs **TireCare.com**, a leading online store for high-quality car parts and tires.  
> **Get 20% off your next tire purchase!** Visit [**TireCare.com**](https://www.tirecare.com) for exclusive deals on top-rated tires and expert maintenance tips.

## Conclusion

The **resource box** might seem small, but it’s a powerful tool for **driving traffic**, **building authority**, and **improving SEO**. By including relevant keywords, a strong CTA, and compelling content, you can significantly increase the chances of readers clicking through to your site.

Don’t underestimate this little space — craft it wisely, and watch your **traffic** grow. The more effort you put into writing a resource box that stands out, the better your chances of **converting visitors into customers**.
