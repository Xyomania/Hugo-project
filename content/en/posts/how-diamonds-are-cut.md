# How Diamonds Are Cut

Diamonds, in their rough form, may appear dull and unremarkable. However, through an intricate process of cutting and polishing, they transform into the sparkling gems we are familiar with. This process is essential for bringing out the diamond's brilliance and maximizing its visual appeal.

## The Cutting Process

1. **Initial Cutting**: The rough diamond is first cut into a round shape. This basic round form is the foundation for creating various diamond shapes, such as oval, heart, and pear. The round shape is often used for a **brilliant cut**, which maximizes the diamond's sparkle.

2. **Creating Facets**: During the cutting process, the diamond is shaped into many flat surfaces called facets. These facets are carefully designed to allow light to reflect and refract, creating the diamond's characteristic shine. The quality of the cut is crucialâ€”an improperly cut diamond will lose light and fail to sparkle effectively.

3. **Final Shape**: Once the facets are formed, the diamond is shaped into its final form, whether it's an **emerald cut**, **princess cut**, or another style. Each cut influences how the diamond reflects light, which is why the precision of the cutting process is essential.

4. **Polishing**: After the cutting process, the diamond is secured in a **dop** (a tool that holds the diamond steady). The edges of the diamond are smoothed using another diamond, as only diamonds are hard enough to polish other diamonds. The final step is polishing the diamond on a **scaif** or polishing wheel, giving it the brilliant shine we recognize.
