## 2. Create Keyword-Rich, Valuable Content

Search engines prioritize websites that provide relevant and high-quality content. Here's how to optimize your content:
- **Keyword Research**: Use free tools like Google Keyword Planner or Ubersuggest to identify the best keywords.
- **Content Creation**: Write articles, guides, or blog posts that naturally incorporate these keywords.
- **Value First**: Ensure your content addresses the audience's pain points or questions.

A good domain name improves user recall and increases the chances of direct traffic, positively influencing your SEO.
