## Seven Gardening By the Yard Tips  

Having a small yard doesn’t mean you have to compromise on having a beautiful garden. With a bit of determination and knowledge, you can transform your yard into a lush, well-maintained space. Here are seven tips to keep your garden vibrant and attractive.  

---

### 1. **Deadheading**  
Regularly remove wilted flowers and dried leaves from your plants. Deadheading encourages plants to produce more blooms and maintain their beauty for longer.  
- Plants like geraniums, dahlias, and some annuals greatly benefit from this practice.  

---

### 2. **Pinch Out Tops**  
Pinching out the tops of certain plants stimulates bushier growth and more blooms.  
- Foliage plants like **Coleus** thrive when their tops are pinched.  
- **Fuchsias** can become leggy without regular pinching.  

---

### 3. **Fertilize Lightly**  
Fertilizing your plants properly is essential for healthy growth:  
- Frequent watering can deplete soil nutrients, so fertilize regularly.  
- Use liquid fertilizer fortnightly for better absorption.  
- For container plants, a half-strength solution of liquid fertilizer works wonders.  

---

### 4. **Weed Out Regularly**  
Weeds compete with your plants for nutrients and water. Regular weeding keeps your garden healthy and neat.  
- If the weeds haven’t gone to seed, leave them on the soil surface to decompose as mulch.  
- Use a wick applicator for applying weedicide to minimize harm to your plants.  

---

### 5. **Water Them Well**  
Proper watering is key to a thriving garden:  
- Soak your yard thoroughly once a week instead of frequent shallow watering.  
- Deep watering encourages deeper root growth, making plants more resilient during dry spells.  
- Prevent runoff to avoid soil erosion.  

---

### 6. **Say No to Chemicals**  
Chemicals can harm beneficial insects and disrupt the natural balance of your garden. Instead:  
- Opt for organic alternatives to control pests and promote healthy growth.  
- Natural methods are safer for humans, pets, and the environment.

### 7. **Mind the Aesthetics**  
A well-kept garden by the yard not only enhances your outdoor space but also increases its charm. By following these tips, your garden will soon be the envy of your neighborhood.
