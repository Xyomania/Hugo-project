## Hawaii Fishing Tips

Fishing in Hawaii offers the perfect combination of adventure, relaxation, and natural beauty. To make the most of your fishing trip, follow these helpful tips for a memorable experience.

### **1. Choose a Boat Wisely**

When selecting a boat for your fishing trip, consider your specific needs. Make sure the boat meets your goals, such as the type of fishing you want to do and how you plan to handle the fish you catch. 

### **2. Choose the Appropriate Island**

Hawaii has several islands offering different fishing experiences. For shorter trips, select an island with deep waters close to the shore, which is ideal for quick fishing and shorter excursions.

### **3. Bring Your Own Gear**

While some boat companies provide tackle, bait, ice, and water, it's always best to confirm beforehand. Tackle is used for hoisting and pulling, bait is for attracting fish, ice keeps your catch fresh, and fresh water keeps you hydrated throughout the day.

### **4. Dress Comfortably**

Hawaii’s sunny weather calls for comfortable attire. Wear a T-shirt and shorts, and don’t forget to bring an extra T-shirt to stay dry and comfortable during the trip.

### **5. Bring a Baseball Cap**

A baseball-style cap will provide much-needed shade to protect you from the sun’s strong rays while fishing.

### **6. Pack Polarized Sunglasses**

Polarized sunglasses are essential for spotting fish in the water and protecting your eyes from the sun.

### **7. Wear Closed-Toe Boating Shoes**

Closed-toe shoes are essential for safety on the boat, preventing your feet from slipping, especially when the action gets intense.

### **8. Pack Snacks and Drinks**

If the boat doesn’t provide food and drinks, bring your own. Cans are safer than glass, and snacks like chips (e.g., Cheetos and Doritos) are easy to enjoy at sea.

### **9. Medicine for Seasickness**

To minimize seasickness, ensure you’re well-rested by taking an 8-hour sleep before the trip. Being fully awake can help prevent feeling seasick.

### **10. Eat Properly Before the Trip**

A full dinner the night before and a light breakfast will keep you energized and prevent discomfort during the trip.

### **11. Bring Sunscreen**

Protect your skin from harmful UV rays by applying sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher before heading out on the water.

### **12. Plan Your Transportation**

Make sure you have a plan for getting to the harbor on time. Whether you take a cab or rent a car, ensure you arrive early for the fishing trip.

By following these tips, you’ll be well-prepared for a successful and enjoyable fishing adventure in Hawaii.
