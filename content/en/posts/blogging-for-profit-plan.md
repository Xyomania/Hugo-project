# Blogging for Profit Begins With a Long Term Plan

Many people dream of blogging for profit, and this goal is not far beyond the reach of someone with average intelligence, a willingness to work hard, and a basic grasp of blogging technology. However, very few people manage to reap the profits they want from their blog. Most people who attempt to make money with their blogs do not succeed for two reasons:

1. **Unrealistic Expectations**: Bloggers often have unrealistic expectations of how fast their readership will grow and how much money they will make. When these expectations are not met, the disappointment can crush their desire to continue blogging.

2. **Lack of Planning**: The other trap that many bloggers fall into is the lack of planning. To succeed in blogging for profit, you need a realistic plan and the discipline to stick to it.

## The Key to Success: A Large Readership

To succeed at blogging for profit, the main thing you will need is a large readership. The higher your traffic, the more advertisers will agree to pay you. However, cultivating the regular visitors you need in order to make a profit isn’t easy. With the increasing number of blogs appearing each day, a great idea or wonderful writing style is no longer enough to get attention.

You need to be able to market your blog effectively. Too many bloggers spend all their time writing posts and almost no time marketing their project. While frequent updates are important for maintaining visibility in search engines and blogrolls, it doesn’t matter how often you update if nobody is reading your page. 

## Marketing Your Blog

To make your blogging for profit dreams a reality, try decreasing your number of posts and use some of that time to market your blog. Set up link exchanges, make contacts in the blogging community, and follow other established methods of winning traffic.

## Patience is Key

Even with the best marketing strategies or a fantastic idea, success in blogging will not happen overnight. Building the kind of readership that blogging for profit requires takes time. It will likely be several months before you begin seeing a significant profit. 

During this initial phase, stay committed to your blogging project. Set goals for how often you will update and how many readers you want to attract. Then, reward yourself for sticking to your plan and staying motivated during this challenging period.
