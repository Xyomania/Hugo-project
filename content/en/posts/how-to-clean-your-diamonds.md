# How to Clean Your Diamonds: Easy and Effective Methods

Over time, your diamonds may lose their brilliance due to dirt, oils, and grime buildup. Fortunately, cleaning your diamond jewelry is a simple and quick process that can restore its fiery sparkle. Here’s how you can keep your diamonds looking as brilliant as the day you first saw them.

## 1. Regular Cleaning with Soap and Water

For light cleaning, you can easily use a small soft brush (like an eyebrow or lipstick brush), mild detergent, and warm water. Follow these steps:

- Prepare a bowl of warm, soapy water with a mild dish detergent.
- Place your diamond jewelry into the bowl and gently brush the diamonds with the soft-bristled brush while they’re submerged in the soapy water.
- Rinse the jewelry thoroughly under warm water to remove any soap residue. Use a small kitchen strainer to prevent your jewelry from slipping down the drain.
- Pat your diamonds dry with a lint-free cloth or a jewelry polishing cloth.

This method is effective for removing oils and dust, helping your diamonds sparkle with minimal effort.

## 2. Stronger Cleaning with Ammonia Solution

If your diamonds need a deeper clean, a stronger solution can help. Mix equal parts of water and ammonia (half-and-half) and soak your diamonds for about 30 minutes. After soaking:

- Gently brush the mountings and prongs with a small brush.
- Swish the jewelry around in the solution before rinsing and patting it dry.

This method is useful for diamonds with stubborn grime or residue buildup.

## 3. Commercial Jewelry Cleaners

If mixing solutions isn't your style, many department stores offer liquid jewelry cleaners. These kits usually come with everything you need, including the cleaning solution and a container for soaking. Be sure to check the label to ensure it’s safe for diamonds, and carefully follow the instructions provided.

## 4. Ultrasonic Cleaners

For the "high-tech" approach, ultrasonic cleaners use high-frequency sound waves to remove dirt and grime from your jewelry. These machines are efficient and quick, but it’s essential to read the user manual to ensure the cleaner is compatible with diamonds and their settings.

## Tips for Maintaining Diamond Shine

- **Handle with care**: Avoid touching your clean diamonds with your fingers, as oils from your skin can cause smudges. Always hold your jewelry by the edges or prongs.
- **Regular cleanings**: Even if your diamonds don't look dirty, regular cleanings will help maintain their brilliance.
