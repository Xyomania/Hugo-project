# Choosing The Right Free Blogging Tools

There are many free blogging tools on the market, but loading up your blog with all of the free accessories that you can find isn't necessarily a good idea. While it may be tempting to add a visitor counter, a flashy background, an exciting new font, and a cluster of quirky animated gifs to your blog, this kind of plan can easily backfire. The key to getting the most from free blog tools is being selective.

## Be Selective About Free Tools

It is a great idea to learn about all of the kinds of free blogging tools that are available so that you can make an informed decision about what to add to your blog. However, just because you can have something doesn't mean that you need it. Practice restraint and only choose the options that you think will truly be useful for your blog.

For example, if you can already track how many visitors are reading your blog through traffic statistics, adding a visitor counter may just clutter up your page without adding value. Similarly, if your blog is text-based, a flashy background can often be more of a distraction than a benefit.

## Assessing What Enhances Your Blog

Be realistic when assessing what kinds of blog accessories will help you achieve your vision and improve the user experience. Remember that even a free tool may not always be an asset in the long run. Focus on tools that align with the goals and style of your blog, rather than just adding features for the sake of it.

Choosing the right blogging tools is about balance â€” using just the right ones that contribute to the functionality, appeal, and performance of your blog without overloading it with unnecessary elements.
