## 3 Tips in Landscaping Your Garden

Landscaping is often a large task that requires both time and energy. But before you hire a professional, here are a few tips that could save you time and money.

---

### 1. Plan Your Design

Spend some time thinking about exactly how you want your garden to look in the final design. Consider both style and function. Do you want to include an area for entertaining or a barbecue? Will there be a space for children to play, a fishpond, or a swimming pool? Also, think about the types of plants you'd like. Start by focusing on the area where you spend the most time, as that's a good place to begin.

### 2. Think Twice Before Hiring a Professional

While hiring an independent designer might cost you hundreds of dollars, you could access free plans online or at a local nursery. However, if your garden space is particularly challenging, like steep ground or other unique features, a professional might offer the expertise to avoid costly mistakes.

### 3. Consider Your Home's Style

The style of your home should be factored into the design. For example, a rural cottage will look out of place with a formal garden. Think about your lifestyle, too. Do you enjoy spending time maintaining flower beds and pruning plants, or would you prefer a low-maintenance garden? Choose a style that aligns with your preferences and the amount of time you can dedicate to upkeep.

## Common Landscape Styles

Here are some popular landscaping styles you can consider for your garden:

### a. Formal
This style uses straight lines and geometrical shapes. Plants are arranged in an orderly fashion, with much attention given to pruning and maintaining perfect shapes.

### b. Informal
Works well with cozy cottages, this style includes curved edges and random plant placement, creating a more natural, flowing look.

### c. English Garden
This style focuses on harmony between the houseâ€™s architecture and the garden. It combines order and nature for a balanced, serene landscape.

### d. Formal/Informal Garden
A mix of formal and informal elements, this style often includes a brick walkway leading to a circle of plants, offering both structure and natural beauty.

### e. Oriental
Typically found in smaller backyards, this style incorporates rocks, evergreens, and water features. A variety of plants create interesting angles and focal points.

### f. Woodland
Ideal for homes with wooded backyards and sloping ground, this style integrates natural elements and creates a peaceful, shaded retreat.
