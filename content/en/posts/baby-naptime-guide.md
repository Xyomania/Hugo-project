Establishing healthy naptime routines is essential for your baby’s development and overall well-being. If your baby struggles to nap, adjusting their routine and observing their behavior can make a significant difference. Here’s how to guide your little one toward better naps.

## Recognizing Sleepy Cues

If your baby isn’t napping well during their first few months, they might be overstimulated. Try reducing their awake time by 15-minute increments. Watch for signs of sleepiness, such as:

- Yawning.  
- Rubbing eyes.  
- Fussiness.  

Put them down for a nap at the first signs of sleepiness to avoid overtiredness, which can make napping more difficult.

## Letting Your Baby Self-Soothe

Some parents worry that allowing their baby to cry during naptime might harm them. However, 15-20 minutes of crying is generally not harmful. Babies learn to self-soothe and fall asleep independently if given the chance. This ability is essential for them to fall back asleep if they wake up during the night.

### Tips for Self-Soothing:
- Allow your baby to cry for 10-15 minutes before intervening.
- If they continue crying, check on them without picking them up—pat their back or bottom until they calm down.

## Napping by Age

Your baby’s napping needs will evolve as they grow. Here’s a breakdown of typical sleep patterns by age:

### Newborn (0-2 months)
- **Sleep duration**: 16-20 hours per day, including naps between feedings.  
- After feeding, keep your baby awake briefly before putting them down to avoid overstimulation.

### Two Months
- **Key milestone**: Begin teaching self-soothing during naps and bedtime.  
- Crying when put down is normal. Check on your baby if they cry for more than 10-15 minutes, but avoid picking them up.

### 3-6 Months
- Babies may drop their third nap (late afternoon nap).  
- Encourage your baby to stay awake during late afternoons to ensure a smooth bedtime routine and longer nighttime sleep.

### 16+ Months
- Most children stop taking morning naps, transitioning to a single longer nap in the afternoon.  
- **Sleep duration**: 10-12 hours at night, plus a 2-3 hour afternoon nap.

## Ground Rules for Naps

1. **You decide the nap schedule**: Set consistent nap start and end times.  
2. **Wake-up cues**: Babies older than four months who wake crying may still need more rest. Check for:  
   - Dirty diapers.  
   - Uncomfortable sleeping positions.  
   - Temperature discomfort (too hot or cold).  
   Fix the issue and encourage them to go back to sleep. Babies who have enough rest will wake up happy and alert.

By understanding your baby’s needs and sticking to a routine, you can help them develop healthy sleep habits that benefit their mood and overall growth.
