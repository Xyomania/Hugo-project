## Fishing Tips for Beginners

Fishing can be a fun and relaxing adventure, but for first-timers, the overwhelming variety of fishing equipment, techniques, and advice can be daunting. To simplify your fishing experience, here are the basic things you need to know for your first fishing trip.

### **1) How to Fish with Bait**

#### *Tackle*

To cast your bait effectively, you’ll need to purchase lead weights. The weight of the lead will vary depending on the water current. Anglers commonly use bank sinkers paired with a number-two hook. 

To prevent the sinker from sliding, you will need a swivel to act as a stop. Using plastic beads between the swivel and weight helps protect the knot. For a more advanced setup, you can rig sliding sinkers using two appropriate swivels.

#### *Bait*

The most commonly used bait for various fish species is worms, and chicken liver is also popular. Ensure the bait is fresh and kept cold to prevent it from getting soft, which can cause it to slip off the hook.

Other commonly used baits include cut-baits (such as skin from fried chicken), fish entrails, grasshoppers, salmon eggs, shrimps, and crayfish tails.

### **2) Basic Fishing Methods**

There are three basic methods of fishing:

#### *Plunking*

This is the most common method. Use the appropriate amount of weight to hold the bait in place against the current. You can also use minimal weight to allow the bait to drift with the current.

#### *Back Bouncing*

In deeper water, back bouncing involves lifting the bait off the bottom and raising the rod tip one to two feet. Let the bait follow the current as you free the back reel or spool. Repeat this process when the lure settles to the bottom.

#### *Drift-Fishing*

This is a simple technique where you cast upstream or downstream, depending on the current. Allow the bait to drift, counting the appropriate depth and reeling as needed.

### **3) How to Fish from a Boat**

Fishing from a boat offers different techniques, especially when fishing in deeper water. For deeper waters, you will need heavier jigheads to keep the bait near the bottom, and the line should go straight down from the boat.

A useful boat fishing technique is trolling slowly while using a fishing device called a bottom-walker, which helps keep your bait near the water's bottom.
