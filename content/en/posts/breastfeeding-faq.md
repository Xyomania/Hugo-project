## Q&A on Breastfeeding

### Q: How often should a newborn be nursed?  

**A:** A newborn should be nursed at least **8 times a day**. The frequency depends on how long they sleep between feedings at night. If your baby sleeps up to four hours at a stretch, you may only need to feed them twice between 11 PM and 7 AM. Feeding them right before bedtime might reduce the need to wake up more than once overnight.

### Q: How often should an older baby be nursed?  

**A:** For older babies:  
- Feed every **3-4 hours** during the day.  
- As they grow, they will nurse less frequently but consume more during each session.  

For babies over six months old, aim for no less than **5 nursing sessions per day**. If your milk supply decreases, consider adding one or two extra feedings to boost supply.

### Q: How do I drop a feeding as my baby gets older?  

**A:** Babies often adjust their feeding patterns naturally as they grow. Here are some common transitions:

#### 1. **Switching from every 3 hours to every 4 hours**  
- This often occurs when your baby’s sleep patterns shift. Babies on a 3-hour feeding schedule usually take 3 naps a day. When they move to a 3.5-4 hour schedule, they may drop their last nap or shorten one of their other naps. This typically happens around **3 months old**.

#### 2. **Dropping the middle-of-the-night feeding**  
- Most babies stop needing a middle-of-the-night feeding between **6-14 weeks old**. You’ll know they’re ready when they sleep through the night without waking you for a feeding. Be prepared for fuller breasts in the morning as your body adjusts.

#### 3. **Dropping the late-night feeding**  
- The late-night feeding is often the hardest to eliminate. If you’re unsure whether your baby is ready, gradually push this feeding back by **15-minute increments** until it aligns with your desired bedtime routine. If the last two feedings of the day are close together, don’t worry—this is temporary and will resolve as your baby’s routine stabilizes.

### Final Note: Adjusting to Changes  

When dropping feedings, your baby may need to consume more during the day to compensate. Pay attention to their hunger cues and feed on demand when necessary. By being flexible and observant, you can ensure a smooth transition for both you and your baby.
