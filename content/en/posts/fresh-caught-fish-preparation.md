### Handling and Storing Fresh Fish

#### **1. Avoid Bruising**
- Handle the fish gently as soon as it lands to prevent bruising.
- Wash it immediately using potable water to remove slime and bacteria.  
  - **Important**: Avoid using water from marinas or areas near industrial discharges.

#### **2. Chill Immediately**
- To prevent spoilage, chill the fish within an hour of catching it.
- Store fish in a cooler with ice:  
  - Use **3 inches of ice depth** and ensure the fish is completely covered (1 pound of ice per pound of fish).
- Rinse fish with **chlorinated water** (1 teaspoon of bleach per quart of water) for added cleanliness.

#### **3. Clean Promptly**
- Clean the fish as soon as possible to maintain its freshness.
- Fish scales can harbor bacteria, so remove them carefully:
  - Avoid rough handling to prevent bacterial spread.
  - Cut the belly and remove viscera to ensure thorough cleaning.
- Do not soak fillets in freshwater for too long as it can weaken the meat texture and flavor.

### Cooking Tips for Fresh Fish

#### **General Rules**
- Always **cook fish for 10 minutes per inch of thickness** at its thickest part.
- For foil-packed or sauce-baked fish, cook for an additional **5 minutes**.
- Double the cooking time for frozen fish.

#### **Thawing Frozen Fish**
- For best results, thaw frozen fish slowly in the refrigerator for 24 hours.
- Alternatively, run wrapped fish under cold water, but **never thaw at room temperature** to prevent spoilage.
- If cooking fish directly from frozen, allow extra time but avoid overcooking to maintain its texture.

### Nutritional Value and Storage
- Properly cleaned fish can maintain its nutritional value and eating quality for up to **5 days**.
- Always wash your hands before and after handling fish to minimize contamination.
