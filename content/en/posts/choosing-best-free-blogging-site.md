# Picking The Best Free Blogging Site

Choosing a free blogging site can feel overwhelming because there are so many options. There are several large, well-known free blog-hosting sites that dominate the blogosphere, but there are also smaller, newer platforms. Whether you decide to join an established site like Blogger or choose a smaller, newer venture depends on your priorities.

## Reliability of Established Sites

Reliability is perhaps the best reason to opt for a large and well-known free blogging site. When you choose to have an established brand host your blog, you can feel secure that your blog will not crash frequently and will not disappear unexpectedly. A company that has been around for a while likely has the resources to ensure that technical glitches are minimized, and your blog will run smoothly over time.

## The Appeal of Smaller Sites

However, many bloggers decide that reliability isn’t the only factor to consider. Bloggers who choose smaller, newer blog hosting sites do so for a variety of reasons. One of the key advantages of smaller platforms is an abstract, yet significant, one: bloggers tend to appreciate the underdog nature of smaller services. By opting for a less-established host, a blogger is supporting a startup or a company that is working hard to make a name for itself. There’s something exciting about rooting for the “David” against the "Goliath" of major, established platforms.
