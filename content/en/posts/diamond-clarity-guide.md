# All About the Clarity of Diamonds

When buying a diamond, **clarity** is one of the essential factors to consider. It affects not only the appearance of the diamond but also its value. Understanding diamond clarity and how it is graded can help you make an informed purchase.

## What Is Diamond Clarity?

Many people assume that diamond clarity refers to how clear or transparent the diamond is. However, **clarity** actually measures the **internal and external imperfections** present in the diamond. 

### Types of Imperfections
1. **Inclusions**: Internal imperfections, such as small cracks or mineral deposits.  
2. **Blemishes**: External imperfections, such as scratches or chips on the diamond's surface.

The fewer inclusions and blemishes a diamond has, the higher its clarity grade.

## Clarity Grades Explained

Diamond clarity is graded using a scale established by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA). The grades range from **Flawless** (FL) to **Included** (I). Here’s a breakdown of the clarity grades:

### 1. **FL (Flawless)** and **IF (Internally Flawless)**
- **FL**: No inclusions or blemishes visible under 10x magnification.  
- **IF**: No inclusions, but minor surface blemishes may be present.  
- These diamonds are extremely rare and highly valuable.

### 2. **VVS1 and VVS2 (Very, Very Slightly Included)**
- Contains minute inclusions that are very difficult to see, even under 10x magnification.  
- These imperfections are so tiny that they don’t affect the diamond’s beauty.

### 3. **VS1 and VS2 (Very Slightly Included)**
- Inclusions are visible under 10x magnification but remain difficult to detect.  
- Often considered high-quality diamonds that balance beauty and value.

### 4. **SI1 and SI2 (Slightly Included)**
- Inclusions are noticeable under 10x magnification and may sometimes be visible to the naked eye.  
- A budget-friendly option that still offers brilliance.

### 5. **I1, I2, and I3 (Included)**
- These diamonds have visible inclusions that may affect their brilliance and durability.  
- **I3** diamonds have the most noticeable imperfections and are the lowest clarity grade.

## "Eye Clean" Diamonds

An **"eye clean" diamond** has no visible inclusions or blemishes when viewed with the naked eye. These diamonds often fall in the **VS** or **SI** clarity range and provide excellent value for buyers who prioritize appearance over perfection under magnification.

## How Does Clarity Affect Price?

Clarity plays a significant role in determining a diamond’s price.  
- **Higher grades (FL, IF)** are more expensive due to their rarity.  
- **Mid-range grades (VVS, VS, SI)** offer a balance of affordability and quality.  
- **Lower grades (I)** are the least expensive but may compromise brilliance and durability.

## Tips for Choosing Diamond Clarity

1. **Understand Your Priorities**: If appearance matters most, focus on "eye clean" diamonds.  
2. **Consider Your Budget**: You can save money by choosing a slightly lower clarity grade without sacrificing beauty.  
3. **Inspect the Diamond**: Always view the diamond in person or request high-resolution images to assess clarity.  
4. **Look for Certification**: Ensure the diamond has a grading report from a trusted organization like GIA or AGS.
