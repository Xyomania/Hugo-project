## Ice Fishing Anyone?

Careful planning and preparation can make ice fishing an enjoyable experience, or it can turn into a challenging ordeal. If you want to catch those fish and make the most of your ice fishing trip, check out these essential tips to ensure you're well-prepared.

### **Buy Early**

Start by making a list of the supplies you used last season, then replenish them early. Remember the essentials like Glo-Buster Bluelights or Lindy Tazers. Follow the motto: *wise up, stock up*.

### **Check the Hole on the Ice Floor**

Ensure that the hole in the ice is clean and clear. Ice chips or chunks can cause entanglements in your fishing line, which could result in losing that big catch. Keep the hole clear of any barriers to maximize your chances of success.

### **Fish More, Get the Big Four**

For bait, you'll want to keep a variety of live options on hand, such as wax worms, minnows, PowerBait, and maggots. It's essential to keep your bait separated and alive using coolers like a small Coleman to maintain their freshness.

### **Clean 'Em All Up**

Before you head out, inspect and clean your rods and fishing reels. Use Q-tips to clean out the nicks in every corner of your ice rod, and apply non-freezing oil to lubricate your fishing reels for smooth operation.

### **Heat Up**

Don't forget to pack heaters and plenty of propane cylinders. Ice fishing should be fun, and staying warm is key. Make sure you’re comfortable while fishing, so you can focus on the catch, not the cold.

### **House Up**

Your ice tent should be prepped too. Clean out the tent and lubricate the joints with a light coat of lubricant. If there’s any wear or tear, contact the manufacturer for a repair kit to get it back in good shape.

### **Gear Up**

Safety first! Be sure to have lifeguard spikes and a safety rope. To stay warm, layer up with a good fishing coat like the Carhartt Extremes Arctic Jacket. Protect your feet with Irish Setters Versa Trax shoes to avoid frostbite and stay comfortable all day.

With these tips, you’ll be well on your way to enjoying a successful and safe ice fishing trip. Be prepared, stay warm, and most importantly, have fun!
