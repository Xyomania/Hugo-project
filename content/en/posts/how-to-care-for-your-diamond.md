# How to Care for Your Diamond: Essential Tips for Longevity

Diamonds are considered forever, but proper care is essential to ensure their brilliance lasts for generations. While diamonds are one of the hardest natural materials on Earth, they can still be damaged without proper maintenance. Here are some key tips for caring for your diamond jewelry.

## 1. Annual Checkups by a Professional

To maintain the security and longevity of your diamond, take it to a jeweler once a year for an inspection. The jeweler will check the settings, prongs, and mountings that hold the diamond in place. Any loose or damaged prongs can be repaired to prevent the diamond from falling out and getting lost. Regular checkups will help you catch potential issues before they become costly problems.

## 2. Proper Storage

When not in use, store your diamonds in a fabric-lined jewelry case or box. Keeping each piece in its own compartment will prevent the diamond from scratching other jewelry and vice versa. This is especially important if you store loose diamonds or diamond jewelry that is not frequently worn.

## 3. Handling with Care

Diamonds are incredibly durable but can still be chipped or scratched if mishandled. Always remove your diamond jewelry before engaging in physical work such as cleaning, exercising, or performing tasks that may expose your jewelry to harsh conditions. This will protect the diamond and prevent accidental damage.

## 4. Avoid Contact with Harsh Chemicals

Diamonds are resistant to many substances, but they can be damaged by exposure to bleach, chlorine, and other harsh chemicals. These chemicals can cause discoloration in both the diamond and its setting. Always remove your diamond jewelry before using household cleaners or swimming in chlorinated water to preserve its beauty and integrity.

## 5. Regular Cleaning

Clean your diamond jewelry regularly to maintain its sparkle. Use a soft toothbrush, mild dish soap, and warm water to gently scrub the diamond. Avoid using abrasive materials that can scratch the surface. For a deeper clean, consult your jeweler for professional cleaning options.
