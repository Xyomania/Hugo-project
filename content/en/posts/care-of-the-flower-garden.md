## Care of the Flower Garden

Knowing how to care for your flower garden can make a significant difference in the appearance and overall health of your plants. Here are some simple hints to help your garden bloom with health:

---

### 1. **The Essentials Must Always Be Given Major Consideration**

Your flower garden must have an adequate supply of water, sunlight, and fertile soil. Any lack of these basic necessities will greatly affect the health of your plants. Water the flower garden more frequently during dry spells.

When planting bulbs, ensure they are placed at the correct depth. For shrubs and perennials, avoid heaping soil or mulch around the stem. If you do, water will drain off instead of soaking in, and the stem could develop rot due to overheating.

---

### 2. **Mix and Match Perennials with Annuals**

Perennial flower bulbs need not be replanted, as they grow and bloom for several years. Annuals, on the other hand, bloom for only one season. Mixing a few perennials with annuals ensures that your garden will have consistent blooms year after year.

---

### 3. **Deadhead to Encourage More Blossoms**

Deadheading involves snipping off the flower head after it wilts. This encourages the plant to produce more flowers. Just make sure to dispose of the deadhead properly, as leaving it in the garden could lead to mildew and other plant diseases.

---

### 4. **Know the Good from the Bad Bugs**

Most garden insects do more good than harm. Butterflies, beetles, and bees are pollinators, fertilizing plants by transferring pollen from one plant to another. Around 80% of flowering plants rely on insects for survival.

Sowbugs, dung beetles, fungi, bacteria, and other microorganisms help decompose dead plant material, enriching the soil and making more nutrients available to growing plants.

Other insects, like lacewings and dragonflies, are natural predators of harmful insects like aphids.

---

### 5. **Prune Dead or Damaged Branches**

Always prune any dead or damaged branches from your plants. Fuchsias are particularly prone to snapping when brushed against. If a branch breaks, it can be potted up to give you a new plant, ensuring nothing goes to waste.

---

### Additional Tip

An occasional application of liquid fertilizer when your plants are flowering will help keep them blooming for a longer period.

By following these simple tips, your flower garden will thrive, providing beautiful blooms throughout the seasons.
