# 3 Essential Steps to Take Before Submitting Your Articles to Directories

Article marketing is one of the oldest and most effective methods for driving traffic and improving SEO. By submitting articles to directories, writers and marketers can get their content in front of a wider audience and generate valuable backlinks. However, before hitting that "submit" button, it's crucial to take certain steps to ensure your efforts are not in vain.

Here are the three key things you need to do before submitting your articles to article directories.

## 1. Understand the Core Purpose of Your Articles

One of the most common mistakes is confusing why you're writing an article with why you're promoting it. When it comes to article marketing, there are three primary goals for promoting your content: **branding**, **lead generation**, and **SEO optimization**. However, the reason you write an article should always be to **inform** and **educate your audience**.

If your article doesn’t focus on delivering value, it will not resonate with readers. A content-driven approach, where the article is useful and informative, is essential to getting people to engage with your resource box and take action (such as clicking your affiliate link or subscribing to your newsletter).

### Tip for SEO:
Make sure your article answers a specific question or solves a problem that your target audience is actively searching for. This ensures your content is **search engine optimized** and attracts the right traffic.

## 2. Maximize the Promotional Potential of Your Articles

Many writers and marketers know that articles can help generate backlinks to their sites, but few understand how to truly leverage the full promotional potential of article marketing.

### Keywords and Strategic Placement
By strategically placing **relevant keywords** within your articles (without overstuffing), you can help your article rank higher in search engines. Use **long-tail keywords** in headings and subheadings to increase visibility.

While backlinks are important, getting picked up by **high-authority publishers** or directories with large audiences is even more valuable. Not only will this increase traffic, but it can also help you build credibility and **boost your SEO rankings**.

### Bonus Tip:
Use **anchor text** wisely in your articles. When done correctly, this method can significantly improve the click-through rate and search engine ranking. However, remember that not all directories support this, so ensure you’re submitting to ones that allow anchor text.

## 3. Submit Content That Provides Value to Readers

Submitting articles just for the sake of getting backlinks won’t be enough. Not all article directories or publishers will accept your content unless it meets certain quality standards. **Writing valuable, high-quality content** is essential to gaining acceptance and achieving your marketing goals.

### Follow Directory Guidelines
Before submitting your article, always review the submission guidelines of the directory you’re targeting. High-quality directories often have specific formatting and content requirements. Ensure your article adheres to these standards to maximize your chances of approval.

### Tip for Better Exposure:
Write articles that help solve problems or answer questions that your audience cares about. Content that provides actionable insights and information will be more likely to get picked up by publishers, increasing your exposure. One article shared by a popular publisher can expand your audience exponentially.

## Conclusion: Make Your Article Marketing Count

Before submitting your articles to directories, make sure you're taking the time to create **high-quality, informative content** that will resonate with your audience. By following these three steps—focusing on content quality, maximizing promotional potential, and ensuring your articles provide real value—you can increase both your **traffic** and **SEO rankings**.

The choice is yours: take a little extra time to create valuable content or settle for basic submissions that might generate some links but offer minimal results. By writing targeted, high-quality articles and submitting them to the right directories, you can unlock greater exposure and marketing success.
