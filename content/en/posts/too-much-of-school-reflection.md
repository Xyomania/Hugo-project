Growing up, I quickly learned that school wasn't the only place where I would spend hours of my day. When my mom took on a demanding job as a Divisional Head, my siblings and I found ourselves in an all-too-familiar dilemma: "What do we do with the kids?" The solution, it seemed, was an after-school program. Little did I know, this would turn into a lesson of its own—one that would shape my thoughts on education for years to come.

## The Promise of After-School Programs

At first, the idea of an after-school program sounded great. My parents were thrilled by the brochure that promised to “fill the gap in your child's understanding with fun activities and innovative teaching methods." It seemed like a perfect solution. We were learning new things while our parents were busy with work, earning a living and providing for us. 

However, the reality of the after-school program was far from what was promised. Instead of engaging lessons and creative activities, the most innovative thing that happened was that the teacher wrote down our homework on the board and we spent hours copying it. Boring? Absolutely. But as a kid, you didn’t have much of a choice. Telling my parents the truth would only result in a shift to another class, and honestly, I didn’t think that would make any difference.

## The Struggle with Boredom

The endless hours of schoolwork followed by the same monotonous activities at the after-school program left me exhausted and uninterested. I was bored to tears. Who, after spending a whole day at school, would want to continue with the same textbooks and exercises in the afternoon? Yet, there was a strange sense of duty that kept me going, especially when my parents promised that mom's salary would help buy the latest TV or a new video game.

I had little say in the matter, and so I gritted my teeth and made the best of it, all the while secretly wishing for a way out.

## The Turning Point: A New Program

Everything changed when my sister decided she had had enough. She refused to go to the after-school program, and that was when my parents began to realize something was amiss. Shortly after, we were moved to another program—one that was, thankfully, more engaging.

This new program was bigger, brighter, and seemed to have more fun in store. We had access to a computer, which, back then, was an exciting novelty. Each of us had a turn at the computer, and we felt like we were actually accomplishing something. More importantly, we started doing our homework with minimal assistance, and the activities became more enjoyable. There were acting classes, speech lessons, games, and even painting sessions. Splashing color on canvas and laughing at silly jokes became the highlights of my day. Finally, I started to look forward to my after-school program.

## The Importance of After-School Programs: Full Circle

Now, as an adult with my own child, I find myself in the same position my parents were once in. I need to find a suitable after-school program for my child, and the lessons I learned as a kid have come full circle. The right program isn’t just about filling time; it’s about providing a balanced, enriching experience that keeps children engaged while helping them grow.

I now understand the value of after-school programs more than ever. They’re not just a way to keep children occupied—they are crucial for their development. They should offer a safe, structured environment where children can explore new interests, build skills, and have fun.

Like my parents before me, I hope to find the right educational program for my child, one that strikes the perfect balance between learning and play.

## Conclusion

Looking back, my experience with after-school programs wasn't just a phase of childhood boredom—it was a crucial part of my educational journey. While the programs may not have been perfect at the time, they taught me valuable lessons about what works and what doesn’t when it comes to keeping children engaged and learning outside of the traditional classroom.

Now, as I navigate the world of parenting, I know how important it is to find an after-school program that fosters growth, creativity, and excitement for learning. History, it seems, is indeed repeating itself, and I hope to offer my child the opportunities to enjoy their after-school time, just as I did in the end.
